# Data and code repository

In this repository data and the corresponding code collected and used in my project are contained. Furthermore I also provide high-resolution images of my figures here.

Some scripts rely on a custom made R library (david.sauer.utility) which you can find on my GITHUB page. The remainder of scripts uses tidyverse utilities. The analysis were run with R 3.6.3.
