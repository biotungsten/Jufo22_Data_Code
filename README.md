# Data and code repository

In this repository data and the corresponding code collected and used in my project are contained. Furthermore I also provide high-resolution images of my figures here. Not provided are the images recorded for determination of root length and leaf area themself as well as the images recorded at the CLSM. Those will be provided upon request.

The most current version of FIJI is necessary for running the ImageJ scripts.

Some scripts rely on a custom made R library (david.sauer.utility) which you can find on my github page. The remainder of scripts uses tidyverse utilities. The analysis were run with R 4.1.3.
